//! The four features that were plugins in Deluge.
//!
//! Labels, automatic adding, the block list and the schedule. They are part of
//! the daemon now rather than things to install, which is why none of them has
//! an RPC namespace of its own: there is no `autoadd.set_options` to call,
//! because there is no plugin to configure. Each one reads a key of
//! `core.conf`, so `core.get_config` and `core.set_config` are the whole
//! interface and every existing client already speaks it.
//!
//! Labels are split between two places, for a reason. Which label a torrent
//! carries is a torrent option, so it lives in `torrent.rs` and `core.rs` with
//! the other options. Which labels *exist*, and what each one does to the
//! torrents in it, is in `label.rs` here: a label with nothing in it yet still
//! has to be listable, because that is the one an external client is about to
//! start using.
//!
//! Each module keeps its decisions pure and testable. This file is where those
//! decisions meet a running session, on a timer.
