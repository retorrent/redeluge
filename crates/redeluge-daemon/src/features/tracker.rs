//! Per-tracker rules: what should happen to the torrents of one tracker.
//!
//! A tracker is not something you create, the way a label is. It is whatever
//! the torrents you added happen to announce to, and the sidebar groups them
//! by it already. This file adds the other half of that grouping: a place to
//! say what the daemon should do with the torrents of one tracker, without
//! having to say it again for every torrent that arrives from it.
//!
//! Three rules, each off until somebody turns it on for a named host:
//!
//! * **Remove** a finished torrent after a delay, with or without its files.
//!   The destructive one, and the one that makes a purge complete rather than
//!   a chore: a tracker that asks for a week of seeding gets a rule of a week
//!   and cleans up after itself.
//! * **Move** the files somewhere after a delay, refusing when the
//!   destination has no room for them.
//! * **Label** the torrents, when they arrive, when they finish, or a set
//!   number of hours after they finish.
//!
//! Every delay is in hours and measured from the moment the download finished.
//! What counts as that moment differs between the destructive rule and the
//! other two, and [`finished_at`] is where that difference is written down.
//!
//! The shape is `label.rs`'s, deliberately: a register keyed by name, holding
//! an options dictionary per entry, under one key of `core.conf`. There is no
//! `tracker.*` RPC namespace, because there was no Deluge plugin of that name
//! to emulate, so `core.get_config` and `core.set_config` are the whole
//! interface and every client already speaks them.
