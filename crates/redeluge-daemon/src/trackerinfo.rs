//! What the trackers themselves are doing.
//!
//! The sidebar groups torrents by tracker domain, so `tracker.example.org` and
//! `backup.example.org` share one row and one set of rules. What they do not
//! share is a state: one can be refusing every announce while the other
//! answers, and until this existed the only trace of that was the tracker
//! column of whichever torrent happened to be on the failing one. A tracker
//! that has been down for a week looked exactly like a tracker nobody is
//! seeding from.
//!
//! Two questions come out of that, and this file answers both from the same
//! arithmetic:
//!
//! * Which of my trackers are down? Asked of every domain at once, by the
//!   sidebar, which colours its rows with the answer.
//! * What is going on with this one? Asked of a single domain, by the window
//!   that takes the row apart again and gives each announce URL a tab.
//!
//! Nothing here announces or scrapes. Every figure is one libtorrent was
//! already holding: opening a window is not a reason to send a tracker several
//! hundred requests, which is also why BEP 48's full scrape is switched off
//! nearly everywhere it was ever offered.
