//! The libtorrent session is `Send` but not `Sync`, and its alert loop parks on
//! a blocking call. Putting it behind a mutex would mean either holding that
//! mutex across the blocking wait, which stalls every caller, or waking
//! constantly, which burns a core. So the session lives on one thread that owns

//!
//! Work is a closure rather than a command enum. Fifty-odd operations would
//! otherwise be fifty-odd variants, each with its own reply type, for no gain.
