//! What the daemon did without being asked.
//!
//! Seven things in this daemon act on their own: the queue's share-ratio rule,
//! the idle rule, the disk-space rule, the schedule, a tracker's rules for
//! labelling, moving and removing, and a label's rule for downloads that never
//! start. Three of them move or delete files. Until
//! this existed, the only trace any of them left was a line in the log, which
//! on a container install means `docker logs` and knowing to look.
//!
//! So they write here as well. A short history, in memory, newest first, read
//! back over `redeluge.get_recent_actions`. Not a second log and not an audit
//! trail: it answers "why is that torrent paused" and "what took my files
//! away", which is what somebody asks the moment automatic rules are turned on
//! and is exactly what a log file is bad at answering.
//!
//! In memory on purpose. It is worth nothing after a restart — the state it
//! explains is the state the daemon is in now — and a file would need rotating,
//! locking and a format, for something a person reads twice a month.
