"""Runs the front end's checks in a real browser.

The Web UI is twenty thousand lines of ExtJS that nothing tested. It is not
code you can load in a test runner — it wants a document, a layout and a
browser's idea of what is visible — so this serves it to a real browser and
reads the answers back out of the page.

    tools/ui_harness.py            # run the checks, exit non-zero on failure
    tools/ui_harness.py --serve    # just serve it, for looking at by hand

The bundle is built the way `build.rs` builds it, and the ordering is checked
against that rule rather than guessed: a wrong order is a blank page, and it
looks identical to a correct one until it runs.

A headless browser is found on PATH. There is always one on a GitHub runner
and usually one on a workstation; when there is none, this says so and stops
rather than pretending the checks passed.
