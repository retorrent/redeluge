# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

redeluge numbers its own releases from 1.0.0, and since 1.6.0 that is also the
version the daemon reports to clients. It reported Deluge's `2.2.1` until then;
a client that checks the version to decide whether it can speak to this daemon
may refuse the new one.

## [1.9.0] — 2026-10-05

### Added

- **Banned torrents and blocked trackers.** *Blocklist* on a torrent's menu
  bans it and deletes it with its files; *Block this tracker* in a tracker's
  settings bans everything announcing there and deletes nothing. A banned
  torrent is held — paused, out of the queue, in `Error` with `Blocked: <why>`
  — resume is refused, and the same hash added again is held on arrival. The
  list (`banned.json`) keeps the date, the name once known, the tracker, the
  label and the reason. Tools, *Banned Torrents* shows it.
- **Telling *arr software.** A label's settings take the address and API key
  of the *arr that uses it as its category. A banned torrent of that label is
  taken out of its queue and put on its blocklist, so it looks for another
  release — at the next sweep with *Send banned torrents* on, or when somebody
  presses *Send to *arr*. The key lives in `arr.json` (mode 600), is never
  read back, and setting it needs an admin account.
- **When a tracker went down or came back,** per domain, kept across restarts
  (`tracker-changes.json`), shown in the tracker info window and written to
  Activity.
- **Remove unfinished downloads when the tracker is down** for a set time
  (`remove_when_down`, `remove_down_hours`, a day by default), measured from
  when it went down or when the torrent arrived, whichever is later.
- **Cleanup**: lists what sits in a directory that no torrent accounts for,
  one level deep, and deletes what is picked. What is claimed is decided again
  at the moment of deleting.
- A **Tools** menu on the toolbar holds Peers, Banned Torrents and Cleanup.

### Changed

- **Tracker rules move one torrent at a time.** Free space was measured before
  any move wrote anything, so several moves started together each saw the same
  room and could fill the destination between them. Nothing starts while a
  move is in progress.
- The label and tracker settings windows are laid out like Preferences: the
  sections in a list on the left, one at a time on the right.

### Fixed

- The front-end checks failed on CI when Chrome was still writing its
  temporary profile as it was removed.

## [1.8.1] — 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- **Clicking a tracker in the sidebar showed nothing.** Since 1.8.0 the daemon
  builds only the status fields a client asked for, and the filter was applied
  to that same trimmed status: a field nobody asked to see was missing, and a
  missing field does not match. The grid asks for the columns it draws and the
  Tracker column is off by default, so filtering by a tracker matched every
  time exactly nothing. The keys a filter reads are now built whether or not
  they are drawn, and dropped again before the answer goes out.
  - The same fault took the search box with it — it looks in the name, the
    tracker, the label and the infohash — and the `Active`, `Unregistered` and
    `Dead` rows, which are questions about the rates, the tracker's last word
    and the swarm rather than about the state.
  - It applies to `core.get_torrents_status` as well, so a script that names
    its keys and filters on a field it did not name gets its rows back.

- **`redeluge.test_feed` was readable by a read-only account.** Reading a feed
  is the daemon fetching an address the caller chose, which is not a read of
  anything the daemon holds. It now takes the same level as the other calls
  that reach outside the session.

- **Disconnecting from a daemon left its method list behind.** `system.listMethods`
  kept answering with the methods of a daemon that was no longer connected
  until something connected again.

- The vulnerability scan's report is passed to the shell through the
  environment rather than pasted into the script, which is the difference
  between a package name and a command.

## [1.8.0] — 2026-09-20

### Added

- **The interface asks only for what it draws.** The grid asked for
  thirty-five fields per torrent on every poll; a default column layout draws
  sixteen of them, and somebody who has narrowed their columns draws fewer.
  Measured on a thousand torrents, the whole list went from 824 KiB to 391 KiB
  — half the answer was columns nobody had on screen. The daemon builds only
  what is asked for, so the saving is the same on its side.
  - A column being sorted on keeps its field even while it is hidden, or the
    store would sort on something that stopped arriving.
  - `state`, `label`, `queue` and the two the status bar counts are always
    asked for: they decide icons, hidden labels, order and the two counters at
    the bottom, whether or not a column shows them.
  - Showing a column again changes the question, which is answered with the
    whole list, so the field is there the moment the column is.

- **A tab nobody is looking at stops polling.** A background tab asked for the
  whole library every two seconds for as long as the browser was open — a walk
  of the library on the daemon, an answer built and compressed, and a list
  nobody could see. It stops when the tab is hidden and asks again the moment
  it comes back, so the only work skipped is work whose result nobody would
  have seen. A window behind another window still counts as being looked at,
  which is what somebody with the list on a second screen wants.
  - A hidden tab makes one call every quarter of an hour to keep its session
    alive, because the session's expiry slides with each call and coming back
    to a login window would be a poor trade. It checks the session and touches
    nothing else.

- **A connection answers several calls at once.** The daemon read one request,
  answered it, and only then read the next, so a client that asked it to hash
  forty gigabytes waited in silence — and so did every other call on that
  connection, and the events it had subscribed to, which queued behind the call
  they were about. Calls now run on their own, up to eight per connection, with
  one task writing to the socket so replies and events do not wait for each
  other. Replies carry the id they answer, as they always have, and the Python
  daemon answered out of order too.
  - The three calls that are about the connection itself — the version, the
    login and the event subscription — are still answered in order, because
    they decide what the calls after them may do.
  - Every other call goes through one authorisation check, on the one path
    there is. There is a test that says so, because a second path around it is
    exactly the mistake this shape invites.
- **The peer ledger's sweep no longer holds the daemon.** It asked libtorrent
  for one peer list per torrent with the session thread held from the first to
  the last, which on a large library stalled every client for the length of the
  sweep. It goes in batches of sixty-four now, and whatever a client asked for
  goes in between. Off by default, as before.
- **A password is checked off the worker threads.** scrypt costs about a
  seventh of a second and thirty-two mebibytes, measured; it ran on the thread
  answering the request, so a burst of login attempts blocked every worker and
  the server answered nothing at all — not even a stylesheet — for as long as
  they took. It runs on the blocking pool now, two at a time at most, which
  bounds what a flood can cost whatever address it comes from.
- **`system.listMethods` is answered from memory.** It is the one call anybody
  who can reach the port may make, and it went to the daemon every time. The
  list does not change while a daemon is connected, so it is asked once and
  forgotten when the connection is replaced.

- **A poll sends only what changed.** The torrent list barely moves between
  refreshes: a few speeds, a progress bar, and the other thirty-odd fields of
  every torrent are the bytes they were two seconds ago. Measured on five
  thousand torrents, the whole list is 4.0 MiB of JSON; the same poll with
  nothing moving is 65 bytes, and with five per cent of the library
  transferring it is 34 KiB — about a hundred and twenty times less, on the one
  hop that is usually not local.
  - The browser holds the list and an epoch, and sends the epoch back. When it
    matches what that session was last sent, the answer is the difference; when
    it does not — a reload, an answer that never arrived, a second tab, a
    changed filter or a changed set of columns — the answer is the whole list
    and a new epoch. Being wrong in that direction costs bandwidth; being wrong
    in the other would show a list that quietly stopped being true.
  - An epoch is never handed out twice for one session, which is what keeps two
    tabs from being answered with each other's differences.
  - The difference is computed by the Web UI server, so the daemon stays as it
    was and every other client keeps getting whole answers.
  - **Send only what changed since the last refresh**, under Preferences,
    Interface, on by default. Turn it off for anything that reads the answers
    itself without keeping a copy of the list between them.

- **The gate runs itself.** It was a script somebody remembered to run; it now
  runs on every push and every pull request, on x86-64 and on arm64, from
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Both architectures, because a test has failed on
  one and passed on the other before. The same workflow scans `Cargo.lock` for
  known vulnerabilities — anonymously, so the scan itself never fails a build;
  only what it finds does.
- **The front end has checks, and they run in a browser.** Twenty thousand
  lines of ExtJS had none. `tools/ui_harness.py` concatenates the bundle the
  way the build does, serves it to whichever headless browser is on the
  machine, and reads the results out of the page: twenty-five checks, every one
  of them there because the thing it checks broke once — a renderer that threw
  on a field the interface had stopped asking for, a poll loop that stopped
  repainting, a constant put on an object that did not exist.
- **The torrent file decoder is fed rubbish on purpose.** Every truncation and
  every single-byte corruption of a handful of real files, four thousand
  randomised inputs, and the depth and length limits, in the same shape the
  rencode decoder's own suite has had. Deterministic, so a failure reproduces,
  and in the gate rather than on a schedule nobody watches.

- **Feeds, and rules that pull torrents out of them.** The watched folders
  cover the case where something else decides and drops a file in a directory;
  this is the other one — a feed you follow and a line saying which of its
  items you want. Under Preferences, Feeds: the feeds in one list, the rules in
  another, off until you turn it on.
  - A rule is a pattern against the title (`*` for anything, case ignored, the
    parts in the order you wrote them), optionally a second pattern for what to
    leave out, and what to do with what it takes: a label, a folder, and
    whether to add it stopped. A rule that names no feed applies to all of
    them, and the first rule that wants an item is the one that gets it.
  - Three limits, because a rule that adds torrents by itself has to be boring:
    a rule with no pattern takes nothing rather than everything, the first look
    at a feed notes what is in it and downloads none of it, and an item is
    acted on once — which is remembered per feed, capped, and kept across
    restarts.
  - Both formats are read. What the daemon needs from an item is a title, a
    link and something stable to call it by, and RSS and Atom put those in the
    same few tags, so it is a scanner rather than an XML dependency for the
    daemon. A feed that offers an enclosure is downloaded from that; one that
    offers a magnet is added from the magnet.
  - What a feed added shows up in Activity, under Feed, beside everything else
    the daemon does on its own.
- **A backup of the settings, and a way to put one back.** Under Preferences,
  Other: one file with everything set here and in the daemon — the labels, the
  tracker rules, the stuck rule, the notifications, the watched folders, the
  block list, the schedule and the feeds. The torrents are listed in it rather
  than exported, because a torrent is its file and its resume data and a list
  of names cannot bring either back; what the list is for is knowing what you
  had. Passwords and pinned certificates are left out on purpose: a backup that
  carries them is a credential sitting in a downloads folder. A restore cannot
  change how the server is reached, for the same reason the interface cannot.

- **A label can refuse to have its torrents removed**, and it outranks the
  tracker rules. A tracker rule is the terms of a whole domain — remove
  finished torrents after a week — and a label is somebody naming the
  exceptions by hand, so when the two disagree the label wins and nothing is
  removed. The switch is under Removal in a label's settings.
  - It covers every removal the daemon decides on its own: the tracker rule,
    which skips those torrents, and the rule for downloads that never start,
    which pauses them instead of deleting them. It also turns that label's own
    *Remove at ratio* off, because a label that says both is contradicting
    itself and the half that keeps the torrent is the half to obey.
  - It does not cover pressing Remove. That is a person saying so about one
    torrent, now, and a setting is not an argument against it.
  - The countdown a protected torrent shows in the list stops at nothing
    rather than counting down to a removal that will not happen, and the
    preview in the tracker window says how many its labels are keeping.

### Changed

- **A poll costs a tenth of what it did.** Measured on a library of 400
  torrents: one refresh of the Web UI took 127 ms of the daemon's time and now
  takes 12 ms, and the daemon's background cost with nobody watching fell from
  16% of a core to 4%. Five things were paid for and never used:
  - libtorrent was asked for the piece map of every torrent on every status
    call — one entry per piece, copied for a sweep four times a second, for
    every rule's pass and for every poll. Nothing read it. The one place that
    needs a piece map, the peer list's "useful pieces", asks for it itself.
  - every status was built whole, about ninety keys, and then filtered down to
    the thirty-five a client asked for. It is built to the keys now.
  - the filtered keys were copied out of the status rather than taken out of
    it, so every name, path and tracker was allocated twice per poll.
  - a torrent's tracker list was fetched from libtorrent for every torrent in
    every sweep, to fall back on when nothing had been announced to yet. It is
    fetched when that fallback is needed, or when the `trackers` key was asked
    for.
  - every torrent's status came from one call per handle, each taking
    libtorrent's session lock; they come from one call for the session now.
  - the tracker a torrent falls back to, for the ones that have not announced
    yet, was asked of libtorrent once per torrent per pass. Every
    `torrent_handle` method is answered by libtorrent's own thread, so each of
    those was a round trip between threads — thirty microseconds that became
    two thirds of a poll on a library of four hundred, and that every paused
    torrent and every torrent in the first minute after a restart paid. The
    first tracker of each torrent is remembered now, and forgotten when the
    trackers are replaced or a magnet's metadata brings its own.
- **State files are written off the session thread.** The torrent list and the
  resume blobs were written by the thread that owns the libtorrent session —
  the one that answers every call — so every client waited on the disk while a
  save happened, once a minute for the list and every ten seconds for the
  resume data, one file per torrent. That thread serialises now and a writer
  thread does the writing, in order, with the removals going through the same
  queue so a delete cannot overtake a write of the same file. A shutdown waits
  for the queue, because a clean stop that loses the state it just saved is
  worse than a slow one. The list is written compactly rather than pretty,
  which on a large library was most of the file.
- **One HTTP client for the daemon** instead of one per call. A notification
  built a fresh `reqwest::Client` — connection pool, TLS configuration and
  resolver — for every message it sent, and so did every block list retry and
  every country database fetch. The per-call timeouts moved onto the requests,
  where they belong.
- **One GeoIP lookup per peer** rather than two, for the flag and the name
  beside it. That was two searches of the database per peer per poll for as
  long as the Peers tab is open.
- **Assets are cached for good.** Every URL the page asks for already carries a
  digest of every embedded asset, so it can never answer differently: it is
  served `immutable` now instead of an hour, which is about 370 KiB the browser
  stops re-fetching on each reload. A URL without that parameter still gets the
  hour.
- The daemon's answers are converted to JSON by moving rather than by copying,
  which on a poll of a large library is a second allocation saved for every
  name, path, label and tracker in it.
- **`redeluge.update_ui`**, which answers a torrent list, the sidebar's counts
  and the session totals from one walk of the library. The Web UI asked for
  those as three calls, and the daemon answers one call at a time per
  connection. It asks once now, and falls back to the three against a daemon
  that does not have it — `core.get_torrents_status`, `core.get_filter_tree`
  and `core.get_session_status` are unchanged and still answer on their own.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-09-20

### Changed

- **Every delay is entered as days and hours**, rather than as a number of
  hours alone: the two tracker rules that wait before moving or removing a
  torrent, the one that relabels it, and the rule for downloads that never
  start, in Preferences and per label. A tracker that wants a month of seeding
  was 720 in a box, which nobody types confidently or reads back as a month.
  What is stored has not changed — one number of hours — so a rule set by an
  older build opens as the same delay, split.
- Anything worth a day or more typed into the hours box is carried into the
  days box rather than marked invalid: 36 is a real way to say a day and a
  half.

## [1.6.3] — 2026-09-19

### Added

- **A message when a tracker stops answering**, and another when it answers
  again, under Preferences, Notifications, off by default. One tick for both
  edges: being told a tracker went away and left to find out for yourself that
  it came back is worse than being told nothing. It goes to the same
  destinations as the rest — Discord, ntfy, Gotify or a plain webhook — and the
  plain one gets a `tracker` object with the host, the number of torrents
  behind it and what it said, rather than a `torrent` object with nothing in it.
- It reads the arithmetic the sidebar colours its rows with, so a message and a
  red row cannot disagree about which tracker is down: failing every announce
  and getting nothing through, not one stale announce among working ones. A
  domain has to hold its new answer for two minute-apart sweeps before anything
  is sent, so a single dropped announce is not a message.

## [1.6.2] — 2026-09-18

### Added

- **Making a torrent, from a file or a whole directory.** `core.create_torrent`
  existed and hashed the content; what it could not do was be used. It answers
  only when the file is finished, and the daemon serves one call at a time per
  connection, so the Web UI — which has exactly one — would have frozen for the
  length of the hashing and then timed out at thirty seconds anyway.
  `redeluge.create_torrent` starts the work and answers with a job id at once.
  `redeluge.get_create_torrent` says how far along it is,
  `redeluge.get_created_torrent` hands back the finished file, and
  `CreateTorrentProgressEvent` arrives throughout, throttled to a hundred
  events for a run however many pieces it has. Finished files are kept for ten
  minutes and eight at a time: a daemon is not a file server.
- **`add_to_session`**, which Deluge's signature has always had and this
  ignored. A torrent created with it set is added and starts seeding the
  content it was built from, in seed mode: every piece was hashed a moment
  ago, so reading the whole directory a second time to check would be the
  difference between seeding now and seeding in ten minutes.
- **`torrent_format`**, likewise ignored. It takes `v1`, `v2` or `hybrid`.
- **A Create button, beside Remove, that works.** Deluge shipped that button
  hidden and wired to nothing: its Web UI could not make a torrent, only the
  GTK client could, so a headless install could not either. It opens a window
  with two tabs — what to make it from, and what to put in it.
- **A browser for the daemon's disk**, which is the whole of choosing what to
  seed when the files are on another machine and there is nothing to upload.
  It starts at the download location and can climb anywhere the daemon can
  read. `redeluge.list_directory` answers it; `core.get_completion_paths`
  could not, because it offers directories only and a single file is a
  perfectly good torrent.
- **A Download button beside Create**, enabled once there is something to
  download. The window sends the file to the browser on its own when it is
  asked to, but a browser that blocks that leaves nothing to click, and a
  torrent built while somebody was looking elsewhere has to still be
  collectable afterwards.
- **The window fits the browser it is opened in**, at whatever size that is,
  and again whenever the browser is resized. A window of a fixed size in a
  shorter browser puts its own buttons below the fold, where no scrollbar
  reaches them, because it is the window that overflows and not the page.
- **The finished torrent comes back to the browser** from `GET /created/<job>`,
  which takes the bytes straight off the wire: a `.torrent` cannot come back
  through a JSON-RPC result, because the bridge renders anything that is not
  text lossily. It can equally be written on the daemon, or seeded, or all
  three at once.
- **An icon that says what the button does.** Deluge's `create` icon was a page
  with a pencil, which is every program's "edit a document" and says nothing
  about hashing a directory; and the set had a drive and a page and nothing in
  between, so a folder in the new browser would have been a hard disk. Both are
  drawn now, in `tools/draw_icons.py`, from the palette the shipped icons set.

### Changed

- **The image version is no longer kept in `.env`.** It was a second copy of
  the number in `Cargo.toml`, maintained by hand, and it disagreed: the
  shipped example said 1.5.1, a working tree said 1.0.2, and the binaries
  inside said 1.6.1. A locally built image is tagged `redeluge:local` and
  carries no version. The publish workflow reads the real one from
  `Cargo.toml`, as it always did.

### Fixed

- **A torrent made with Deluge's own arguments had no tracker.** Argument one
  of `core.create_torrent` is the primary tracker and is a *string*; this read
  it as a list, so a client passing the announce URL exactly as Deluge
  documents it got a torrent with no tracker in it and no error to say so. The
  separate `trackers` list, argument eight, was not read at all.
- **Torrents came out hybrid v1+v2.** libtorrent 2.0 writes both when it is not
  told which, and a private tracker that only knows v1 refuses the result.
  Deluge writes v1, so this does now unless `torrent_format` asks otherwise.
- **The content of a directory directly under the root was hashed from the
  wrong place.** The parent of `/downloads` came out as `.` rather than `/`,
  which sent the hasher looking for `./downloads` relative to wherever the
  daemon was started. In the container that is `/` and the mistake cancels out,
  which is why it went unnoticed; anywhere else it is a torrent of nothing. A
  trailing slash on the path had the same effect one level down.
- **A piece length that was not a power of two** reached libtorrent, which
  throws rather than rounding, and came back as an exception from C++ with
  nothing to say which argument was wrong. It is checked by name now, and zero
  — meaning "choose one from the size" — is accepted instead of being clamped
  away.
- **Progress reported every piece for anything under two hundred of them.** The
  step was rounded down, so a hundred and ninety-nine pieces divided by a
  hundred is one. The throttle now holds at the bottom of its range too.

## [1.6.1] — 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- **The page was titled with whatever `REDELUGE_VERSION` said**, which was a
  stale number from a container's environment rather than the version actually
  running. That override made sense while the page's number and the daemon's
  were two different things; now that they are one, a second source was only a
  way for them to disagree. The interface reports the compiled version. The
  image still takes a `VERSION` build argument for its registry labels, which
  is a different question and says nothing about what is running.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-09-18

### Added

- **Which of your trackers are down, and why.** Right-click a tracker in the
  sidebar and choose *Info*. A sidebar row is a domain, not a tracker —
  `tracker.example.org` and `backup.example.org` share a row and a set of rules
  — so the window takes the row apart again: a summary of the domain, then a
  tab per announce URL under it, each saying whether that tracker answers,
  what it said when it did not, and what its torrents add up to.
- **The tracker list is coloured by that answer.** A dot per row, in the indent
  the tracker favicon used to sit in: green when announces are getting through,
  red when every announce to that domain is failing, amber when some are or the
  tracker has stopped recognising torrents, grey when nothing has been tried
  yet. A tracker that has been down for a week used to look exactly like a
  torrent nobody is seeding.
- `redeluge.get_tracker_info` answers the first, `redeluge.get_tracker_health`
  the second. Neither announces or scrapes: every figure is one libtorrent was
  already holding, because opening a window is not a reason to send a tracker
  several hundred requests.
- **Nothing is acted on while its tracker is failing every announce.** A
  tracker down for an afternoon looks exactly like a dead swarm from the
  inside, and without this a five hour outage against a four hour rule was a
  library-wide deletion — with the rule working exactly as written. It is not a
  setting: an interlock somebody can switch off is one that will be off on the
  day it was needed.
- **The rule can pause instead of removing**, and file what it paused under a
  label. Pausing is now the default: the action that deletes has to be the one
  you chose. A label whose own rule is off is an exemption, so filing paused
  torrents in one is both how they stop being reconsidered every minute and how
  you find them again.
- **A `Dead` group in the sidebar**, beside *Unregistered*: the torrents whose
  tracker answered and said the swarm is empty. Distinct from a tracker
  refusing to know the torrent, and from one that simply is not arriving —
  which may be your connection.
- **The Peers tab says where each peer was found**: tracker, DHT, PEX, LSD,
  resume or incoming. It is what says whether a torrent still has any way of
  finding anybody: a swarm reachable only through a tracker dies with it.
- **The rule for downloads that get nowhere is no longer a label's alone.**
  Preferences, Queue carries it for every torrent; a label still sets its own,
  and a label with the rule off is an exemption from the daemon's rule rather
  than a fall-through.
- It also stopped being about zero per cent. What it measures is bytes
  arriving, so a torrent that got 3% in the first minute and has not moved
  since is in scope — up to `max_progress`, which is zero by default and keeps
  the original behaviour exactly. Deleting a torrent that is 90% done and
  stalled is a different decision from deleting one that never began.
- The clock is a mark per torrent, taken at the `active_time` where its byte
  count last moved, rather than libtorrent's wall-clock `time_since_download`:
  a torrent paused over a weekend came back three days stale and would have
  been deleted on the first sweep after it resumed, having had no chance at
  all. The marks are in memory, so a restart sets every clock again — for a
  rule that deletes files, waiting longer than asked is the direction to err.
- **A label can throw away downloads that never start.** Under *Downloads that
  never start* in a label's settings: a torrent of that label which has been
  trying for the set number of hours and has not downloaded a single byte is
  removed, with its files unless you say otherwise. A dead magnet looks exactly
  like a torrent between peers, and the only way to tell was to remember when
  it was added.
- The delay is counted in time the torrent spent trying, not on the clock, so a
  queue or a weekend of being paused does not count towards it. It will not
  take a torrent that downloaded anything at all, one that is paused, one that
  is finished with every file deselected, or one that is checking or moving.
  Removals are recorded in *Activity*, under a new **Label** rule.
- Deleting the files is on by default here, unlike the tracker rule's
  equivalent: that one removes torrents that finished, where the files are the
  point, and this one removes torrents that downloaded nothing.

- **Four ways to answer "what client is this?"**, on the Identity page: show
  the truth, hide it, look like a different common client for each torrent, or
  say exactly what you type. An identity is two strings — the user agent
  trackers and peers see, and the fingerprint at the front of every peer id —
  and every mode sets both or neither, because faking one and not the other is
  a combination no real client sends and identifies this daemon more precisely
  than the truth would.
- Rotation draws from a short list of common clients, per torrent as it is
  added. What it cannot do is per peer: both strings are session settings in
  libtorrent, so a different identity for each connection is not buildable on
  it. The peer id is per torrent and kept for that torrent's life; the user
  agent is one string for the whole daemon and follows the most recent draw, so
  older torrents disagree with it. The page says so rather than leaving it to
  be discovered.
- `redeluge.get_identity_clients` answers the list, so the interface names the
  same clients the daemon draws from and the custom boxes can be filled from a
  real one in a single click.
- Stored under a new `identity` key. `proxy.anonymous_mode` is carried into it
  once, on the first start after the upgrade, so a daemon that was hiding keeps
  hiding.

### Changed

- **The daemon reports its own version, not Deluge's.** It answered `2.2.1`
  because that is what a client checks to decide whether it can speak to it;
  it answers this fork's number now, everywhere it is asked — `daemon.info`,
  `daemon.get_version`, the OpenAPI document and the interface. **A client that
  gates on the version can refuse to connect**: Radarr, Sonarr, the GTK client
  and thin clients all look at it. The API they are checking about has not
  changed, only the name on it. The recorded protocol corpora keep Deluge's
  number, because they are captures of Deluge's wire format rather than
  statements about this daemon, and the fork point in the README is attribution
  and stays.
- **Two themes, named for what they are: `dark` and `white`.** The three that
  were shipped were ExtJS's, named after its own palettes — `blue`, `gray` and
  `access`, the last of which is the dark one and says so nowhere. `access`
  became `dark`, `blue` became `white`, and `gray` is gone: it was the second
  light theme, and its images were 420 KB that `blue`'s were not, since those
  are `images/default`, which the other stylesheets share and which ships
  either way. The old names are still accepted and stored as the new one, so
  nobody's interface changes colour on the upgrade.
- **The interface stopped painting light colours on a dark theme.** This sheet
  is loaded before the theme and knows nothing about it, so every fixed light
  background it wrote was a white rectangle across `dark`'s near-black page —
  which is what the new settings boxes looked like. Backgrounds and borders are
  translucent greys now, secondary text is dimmed rather than greyed, and the
  warning red is the brighter of the two from `alert.png`. Twelve files, most
  of them older than the boxes that made it visible.
- The archived record of the Python-to-Rust port — the migration overview and
  its six phases — is out of the wiki. *Migrating from Deluge*, which is how
  somebody moves an existing installation across, stays.

- **Hiding the client identity is its own Preferences page**, no longer a
  fieldset inside the proxy widget. It has nothing to do with proxying: it
  changes what this client says about itself, and it does the same thing
  whether a proxy is configured or not. Sitting on the Proxy page, it read as
  part of proxying — which is how somebody turns it on believing their traffic
  is hidden. The new page says what it does and, just as plainly, what it does
  not: your IP is unchanged, and your peer ID still names the BitTorrent
  library, so a tracker that cares still knows what you are running.
- The setting is still stored under the `proxy` key of the daemon's
  configuration, because that is where Deluge keeps it and clients expect to
  find it there. Both pages hand the options manager a whole proxy dictionary,
  so neither can overwrite the other's half.
- **A label's settings are a window of their own**, reached from *Edit* in
  Preferences, Labels or by right-clicking the label in the sidebar. They used
  to sit under the list, filled in when you selected a row — so reading what a
  label applied was the same gesture as arming an Apply that would write it
  back, and the form belonged to whichever row had been touched last. The
  Preferences page is now the register it always described itself as: Add,
  Edit, Rename, Remove. Double-clicking a row opens its settings rather than
  the rename prompt, which has a button of its own.

## [1.5.1] — 2026-09-16

### Added

- **The Peers window can be searched and sorted.** A box in its toolbar narrows
  by address or client — case-insensitive, anywhere in the string, so `.14.` or
  `qbit` both work — and every column now sorts.
- The search is answered by the daemon rather than applied to what the window
  already holds, and the order matters: the window asks for the five hundred
  biggest takers, and the peer somebody is looking for is usually not one of
  those. `redeluge.get_peers` takes the search as a second argument and narrows
  the ledger before the limit.
- A search that finds nothing says which search found nothing, instead of
  claiming no peers have been recorded.

### Fixed

- **A half-written peer ledger could be left on disk.** The save goes through a
  temporary file and renames it, which is right, but nothing removed that file
  if the rename never happened — and it holds every address the ledger does, so
  deleting `peers.json` left the addresses on disk under another name. A failed
  save now takes its temporary file with it, and a load sweeps any it finds.
  Seen once here, cause not established: the rename works on the mount it
  happened on, and the ledger it was supposed to write survived the restart.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-09-16

### Added

- **A running account of what each peer has done**, in a *Peers* window in the
  toolbar, off until you turn it on there. The Peers tab shows the connections
  open right now at the speeds of the moment, which cannot answer the question
  people actually have about an address: what has it ever given back? A peer
  that takes forty gibibytes over a week and sends nothing looks idle in every
  snapshot, because it is idle in every snapshot — libtorrent's own counters
  belong to a connection and die with it.
- Totals are accumulated by difference, never copied: a sample smaller than the
  last one is a reconnection and the whole of it is new. Sampled every fifteen
  seconds, and only for torrents that have peers.
- What sampling cannot see is a connection that begins and ends between two
  samples: nothing reports a peer's totals as it disconnects, so there is no
  other mechanism to use. The bias is harmless — a peer too brief to sample is
  a peer too brief to have taken anything worth the name — and it is documented
  rather than glossed over.
- Kept in `state/peers.json`, so it survives a restart, for thirty days by
  default and at most twenty thousand addresses, the oldest going first. The
  per-connection counters are dropped on the way out, because they describe
  connections that will not exist next time. Nothing about it is sent anywhere
  and no rule acts on it.
- **A Cross-seeds column**: how many of your contents an address carries on
  more than one of your torrents. Not an accusation, and the documentation says
  so: a peer seeding the same release to two trackers uploads real bytes to
  both, most private trackers allow it, and it is what this daemon's own
  tracker rules help you do. It is the quickest way to confirm your own
  cross-seeding is working. Announcing a fake upload figure — the actual way
  ratios are cheated — is invisible from inside a swarm and is the tracker's to
  detect, not a peer's.
- Two torrents of the same content have different infohashes as a matter of
  course, because a tracker stamps its own `source` into the info dictionary.
  So contents are matched on the file list — names and sizes to the byte, in a
  fixed order — which is near enough for grouping and is never used to delete
  anything.
- Picking a peer names the torrents it was seen in, under the grid, marking
  the ones it also carries on another of yours. The count alone is a fact
  nobody can act on, and the next question is always which.
- `redeluge.get_peers` reads the ledger back, biggest taker first.

- **A fourth tracker rule: bandwidth and connection limits.** The same four
  numbers a label carries — download and upload rate, connections, upload slots
  — imposed on every torrent of a tracker through `core.set_torrent_options`,
  exactly as if you had set them by hand. Applied when a torrent is first seen
  under the rule and again whenever you change it, never on every pass: a
  standing rule that overwrote a limit you set yourself, once a minute, would
  be unusable.
- **The Add dialog says whether there is room** before anything is written: the
  torrent's size against the free space where it is about to land, in red when
  it does not fit. The disk-space rule catches a full disk after the fact by
  pausing everything that writes; this is the same fact said at the only moment
  it is cheap to act on. `web.get_torrent_info` carries a `total_size` for it.
- **The tracker settings window says what the rule would do before you arm
  it**, under the buttons and updated as you type: how many torrents are here,
  how many have finished, how many the rule would remove or move, when the
  first of them would go, and how much would be freed if the files go too. A
  rule that would act on the next sweep says so in those words.

### Fixed

- **Per-peer byte totals were not carried across the FFI at all.** The bridge
  reported each peer's instantaneous speeds and nothing cumulative, so the one
  number that says what a peer is worth was unavailable to everything above it.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-09-16

### Added

- **A tracker can be given rules of its own.** Right-click a tracker in the
  sidebar and choose *Settings*. A tracker is not something you create, the way
  a label is: it is whatever the torrents you added announce to, and the
  sidebar has been grouping them by it all along. This is somewhere to say what
  should happen to that group, once, rather than on every torrent that arrives
  from it. Stored under the `tracker` key of `core.conf`, so `core.get_config`
  and `core.set_config` configure it like every other feature and no RPC method
  was added.
- **Label them.** A torrent from this tracker gets the label when it arrives,
  when it finishes, or a set number of hours after it finishes, and the label
  is created if it is not there yet. Arrival never overwrites a label you set
  by hand; completion does, which is how a torrent moves from the label it
  downloaded under to the one it is kept under.
- **Move them.** The files go somewhere else a set number of hours after the
  download finished — and the destination disk is measured first, because it is
  not always the disk the files are on now: a folder inside the download folder
  can be a mount point for another drive, which is exactly the case that fills
  one up. A move that would leave under a gibibyte free at the destination is
  not started, is logged once, and is reconsidered on the next pass, so freeing
  space is all it takes. A move within one filesystem is a rename that writes
  nothing and is never refused.
- **Remove them**, a set number of hours after they finished downloading, with
  or without their files. What a tracker asking for a day or a week of seeding
  used to make a chore, and what a disk fills up with when nobody does the
  chore. The files are kept unless that tracker's entry says otherwise, so the
  rule as first turned on does what `remove_at_ratio` does: the torrent goes,
  the download stays.
- Every wait is measured from the completion time libtorrent recorded, which is
  kept in the resume data and survives a restart. Nothing is considered before
  a torrent is finished, and one that is still being moved is left alone until
  it lands. A torrent libtorrent never saw finish — one added over files that
  were already on disk — has no such time: labelling and moving fall back to
  when it was added, and removing does not happen at all, because deleting on a
  wait measured from a time nobody knows is the one way this could take
  something unexpectedly.
- The removal is the one `core.remove_torrent` performs and is announced the
  same way, so every connected client lets go of the torrent instead of holding
  a row for something that no longer exists.

- **The torrent list says what a tracker's rule is about to do**, in a *Tracker
  Rule* column beside *Idle*: *removed in 21h*, *moved in 2h*. Removal is named
  first when both are due, because it is the one that cannot be undone. Counted
  in the browser from two new status fields, `tracker_remove_at` and
  `tracker_move_at`, so it ticks between polls instead of being as old as the
  last one, and both are zero — and the column blank — when nothing is coming.
  A rule that announces itself is a rule you dare leave on.
- **Activity, in the toolbar: what the daemon did without being asked.** Six
  things here act on their own — the share-ratio rule, the idle rule, the
  disk-space rule, the schedule, and a tracker's rules for labelling, moving
  and removing — and until now the only trace any of them left was a line in
  the log, which on a container install means knowing to run `docker logs`.
  The last two hundred actions are kept in memory, newest first, with the
  torrent, the rule and why. It answers *why is that paused* and *what happened
  to that download* beside the torrents rather than in a log file.
- The torrent's name is stored with each entry rather than looked up, because
  after a removal there is nothing left to look it up in.
- `redeluge.get_recent_actions` reads it back. A namespace of this fork's own,
  deliberately not `core.*`, so that no client can mistake it for a Deluge
  method and no future Deluge method can collide with it. It is the only one so
  far, and it is advertised in `daemon.get_method_list` like everything else.

- **The torrents a tracker has dropped are a group of their own**, under
  *States* in the sidebar, beside *Active*: **Unregistered**. A private tracker
  that has pruned a torrent answers every announce with *Unregistered torrent*
  or *Torrent not found* for ever, and until now such a torrent was
  indistinguishable at a glance from one that merely has no peers today.
  Right-click the row and *Remove these torrents...* hands the whole group to
  the ordinary Remove dialog, which asks whether to keep the files as it always
  has. Nothing removes anything on its own.
- The check is deliberately narrow: only the phrases that mean "I have no
  record of this". A tracker that is down, refusing connections or
  rate-limiting is not one that has forgotten the torrent, and offering to
  delete a library because a tracker was rebooting would be unforgivable.
- The Remove dialog now says how many torrents it is about to remove when there
  is more than one, rather than "the torrent (s)".

### Fixed

- **A tracker's own failure reason was thrown away.** For a tracker error the
  daemon reported libtorrent's error code, so a torrent whose tracker had
  dropped it said *Error: tracker failure* — true, useless, and impossible to
  tell apart from any other tracker trouble. The reason the tracker actually
  sent is now what the status carries, falling back to the transport error only
  when the tracker did not answer at all. Tracker warnings carry their text for
  the same reason; they used to arrive empty.

### Changed

- The README now says what this program is and is not: a BitTorrent client
  that ships with no content, no trackers and no search, the responsibility for
  what is done with it, and the warranty that free software does not come with.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-09-12

### Changed

- **Changing a filter is about ten times quicker.** Switching the sidebar from
  one state to another took between half a second and three seconds, measured
  on a library of 400 torrents. Three things were wrong, and all three are
  fixed.
- **A refresh asked for while a poll was in flight was thrown away.** The
  browser refuses to start a second poll, which is right, but it also forgot
  that one had been asked for, so the new filter waited for the next scheduled
  poll. Measured: a click 200 ms into a poll sent nothing at all, and the next
  request went out 2.5 seconds later. The request is now remembered and sent
  the moment the one in flight answers.
- **The session thread answered a call only after its alert wait.** It slept up
  to a hundred milliseconds waiting for libtorrent, then swept the status of
  every torrent, and only then picked up the calls waiting for it, so
  `core.get_external_ip`, which reads one string out of memory, took 115 ms. It
  now waits on the calls themselves, drains all of them that are waiting at
  once, and sweeps every torrent's state on a 250 ms timer rather than on every
  pass. The sweep is the most expensive thing that thread does and it grows
  with the library, so this is less processor as well as less waiting.
- **The status bar's external address, free space and rate limits are no longer
  asked for every two seconds.** Each was a round trip on a connection the
  daemon serves one call at a time, and two of them went through the session
  thread, for answers that are the same for minutes or days. They are held for
  a minute, fifteen seconds and thirty seconds, and dropped the moment the
  configuration is written or the daemon changes.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-09-12

### Added

- **A label can be hidden from the torrent list by default.** Preferences,
  Labels, under *In the torrent list*. The same thing as unticking it under
  *Show labels* in the Label column's header menu, except that it starts that
  way and it is stored with the label, so the next machine you open hides it
  too. What a few hundred torrents in a label you never look at were making
  unusable is the list of the ones you do.
- Nothing is hidden from anything but that list. Picking the label in the
  sidebar shows those torrents, because asking for a label outranks hiding it;
  ticking it in the header menu shows it for the session, and a choice made
  there is not undone by the next reconnect. The sidebar's counts, every other
  client and the daemon itself see no difference.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-09-12

### Added

- **Notifications by webhook**, under Preferences, Notifications, off by
  default. A POST when a download finishes, when a torrent goes into error and,
  if you want it, when one is added. Discord, ntfy, Gotify and a plain JSON
  webhook, as many destinations as you like.
- This is what the Execute plugin was really installed for. Execute ran a shell
  script as the daemon user with the torrent's name as an argument, which is a
  remote code execution primitive wearing a convenience hat; this runs nothing.
- Every kind posts JSON rather than using ntfy's header form, because those
  headers cannot carry anything outside ASCII and half the torrent names that
  matter are not ASCII. Gotify's `/message` is appended for you, a token
  already in the URL is left alone, and an ntfy instance living under a path of
  its own keeps that path.
- **Send test** posts a sample to every destination and writes back what
  happened, under the grid: a wrong URL says so on the page rather than in a
  log nobody is watching. A refusal is not retried, a timeout is.
- It does not announce your library on restart. libtorrent reports a torrent as
  finished again after re-checking one that was already complete, which happens
  to every finished torrent at startup, so a completion older than five minutes
  is not treated as news; nor are the torrents restored at startup.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-09-12

### Added

- **A disk-space rule**, under Preferences, Downloads, and the only feature
  here that is on out of the box. Under 1 GiB free, every torrent still writing
  to that disk is paused; over 2 GiB free, the ones it paused are started
  again. Both numbers are yours to change.
- What it prevents is worth stating, because it is the failure that costs more
  than the download: a disk fills, libtorrent fails a write, that torrent goes
  to Error, and the next one does the same a minute later. Nothing resumes on
  its own once there is room, so it ends with thirty torrents in Error and an
  evening spent working out which stopped for this reason and which for
  another. `core.get_free_space` always knew; nothing ever acted on it.
- It reads each filesystem the session writes to separately, so a download
  landing on a disk with room is not stopped because a different disk is full.
  Seeding torrents are never touched, because a seed writes nothing and taking
  it off the swarm would cost ratio for no gain. Queued and checking torrents
  are, because a queued torrent is one the queue is about to start writing.
- It remembers whether the queue was managing a torrent before it took it, and
  gives that back on release: a torrent you were running by hand does not come
  back under the queue because a disk filled up. A path it cannot measure at
  all, an unplugged disk or an unmounted share, decides nothing either way.
- Two thresholds rather than one, because a single one flaps: pause at 1 GiB, a
  piece is discarded, free space crosses back by a megabyte, everything starts
  and stops again a second later.
- The idle rule now holds on to a download whose time is up while the disk is
  full, instead of starting it for the fifteen seconds it takes this rule to
  stop it again.
- **Where you see it.** A counter in the status bar, beside the idle rule's own
  and hidden the same way when it is holding nothing; clicking it opens the
  settings. A line in the torrent's Status tab saying whether this is what
  stopped it. Pressing Resume ends the hold, though a still-full disk takes it
  back on the next pass.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-09-12

### Added

- **A rule that pauses downloads which are getting nowhere**, so the queue can
  move. Off by default. A download under a rate for long enough, with a torrent
  actually waiting for its place, is paused and let go again later. Never the
  last one running, never a torrent taken out of auto-management by hand, and
  downloads only: a torrent that is seeding and transferring nothing is doing
  its job by being reachable.
- The countdown is shown in three places, because the point is to know what is
  about to happen rather than to find out afterwards. An *Idle* column in the
  torrent list, reading "pauses in 4m" and then "resumes in 58m"; a line in the
  torrent's Status tab that says which clock is running and what ends it; and a
  count in the status bar of how many torrents are being held, shown only when
  there are any. All three tick between polls rather than being a sentence the
  server wrote two seconds ago.
- `inactive_down_rate` and `inactive_up_rate` are set from the same threshold
  the rule uses, so libtorrent's own "ignore slow torrents" and this rule agree
  about which torrents are slow. Two mechanisms for the same job, disagreeing
  about the facts, would be impossible to reason about.

- **A search box**, in the toolbar. The daemon has always been able to search:
  its `keyword` filter covers the name, the state, the tracker and its last
  message, the label and the infohash, with every term having to match. Nothing
  in the interface ever sent it. It narrows whatever the sidebar has selected
  rather than replacing it, so searching inside a label works, and Escape
  clears it.
- **Show or hide labels from the Label column's header menu.** Right-click the
  header and untick a label to take it out of the view, including *No Label*
  for the torrents that have none. It is a view filter applied in the browser,
  not a query: the torrents are already here, it is instant, it survives the
  next poll, and it does not argue with the sidebar's own label filter, which
  answers the different question of which single label to look at.
- **Peer countries can actually be filled in.** The flags were shipped earlier
  in this version; what was missing was the data. Deluge pointed
  `geoip_db_location` at `/usr/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat`, a file in the GeoLite
  Legacy format MaxMind retired in January 2019, so that path has held nothing
  for years and Deluge's own flags have been blank just as long. There is now
  an optional downloader, off by default, defaulting to DB-IP's free country
  database: CC BY 4.0, monthly, in the MaxMind DB format the reader already
  takes, and needing no account. It checks weekly, keeps one cached copy, and
  refuses to replace a working database with anything that is not one. A path
  you set yourself still wins.
- **More about each peer.** The country's name in the flag's tooltip, because
  two letters are not something to read. Whether the connection is uTP or TCP
  and whether it is encrypted, both of which libtorrent knew and nothing was
  carrying. And a *Has* column: how many pieces that peer has and we do not,
  which is the one number that says whether a peer is worth having. A seed you
  are already ahead of reads "nothing new"; a peer at three percent may hold
  the piece everything is waiting on.

### Fixed

- **Every session statistic past a certain point was somebody else's.**
  `session_stats_alert` carries one flat array of values and each metric says
  where in it to look; the names were read in list order and counted along it
  instead. The counters and the gauges are numbered in separate ranges, so from
  the point where those diverge every name reported the wrong value: the count
  of connected peers came out as six figures and the DHT node count in the tens
  of thousands. Names are placed at their own index now, and a test asserts
  that for every metric libtorrent publishes rather than for a chosen few.
- **No pause survived a restart.** Resuming the session resumed every torrent
  it could see rather than the ones that session pause had stopped, and the
  scheduler performs a session resume when the daemon starts. So a torrent
  paused by hand, or stopped at its share ratio, came back running on the next
  restart. It now starts what it stopped and nothing else.
- **Stopping at a share ratio did not stop anything** on a torrent under
  automatic management, which is the default. libtorrent's queue resumes an
  auto-managed torrent it finds paused, within about half a minute, so the
  pause had to clear that flag as well and did not. The same trap is why the
  new idle rule clears it.
- A torrent paused by a rule is now recorded as paused on the torrent itself,
  not only in the session, because a restart re-adds every torrent from what
  was recorded.
- **A caption that wrapped onto a second line was drawn over the control
  below it.** Ext JS pins a checkbox row to the height its config asked for and
  does not clip the label inside it, so a long caption spilled into the next
  row, which had already been positioned. The row is laid out as a flex line
  now, so its height is its tallest child and there is nothing to spill; the
  fixed heights that caused it are gone from thirteen places. Checked at three
  window widths across every preferences page: nothing overlaps.
- **Filtering by tracker matched nothing.** The sidebar and the torrent status
  each worked out the tracker host with their own function, and the two
  disagreed: the list showed `tracker.example.com` while every torrent was
  recorded under `example.com`, so clicking the row returned an empty list. The
  empty case was worse, the list saying `Error` where the status said nothing
  at all. There is one function now, and a test walks every row of the sidebar
  and asserts that filtering on it returns the number of torrents the row
  claims.
- The rule that drops a subdomain was a guess about label lengths, and it got
  `x.abc.com` wrong, leaving it ungrouped, and turned the tracker address
  `192.168.1.1` into `168.1.1`, which is not a host. It is Deluge's own rule
  now: an address is left alone, a two-part public suffix like `co.uk` keeps
  three labels, everything else keeps two.
- A torrent showed no tracker until its first announce succeeded, and sat in
  the sidebar under the torrents that have none. It falls back to the first
  tracker it knows about, which is what Deluge does.
- The sidebar's row for torrents with no tracker was blank, like the label and
  owner rows before it. It reads *No Tracker*.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-09-12

### Added

- **The Label plugin's API, answered without a plugin.** Every program built on
  Deluge asks `core.get_enabled_plugins` whether Label is there and refuses to
  set a download category when it is not: Radarr says "Label plugin not
  activated" under the Category field. This daemon reports it and answers the
  eight `label.*` methods, forwarded through the Web UI's endpoint as well as
  the daemon's own port, because that is what those programs connect to.
  `daemon.get_method_list` grows by exactly those methods, which is what a
  Deluge daemon with the plugin enabled advertises.
- A register of labels, under the `label` key of `core.conf`. A label exists
  whether or not a torrent carries it, which is the whole point: the label an
  external client is about to start using is by definition empty, and a list
  derived from the torrents that happen to exist can never contain it.
- **A Labels page** in Preferences: add, rename, remove, and the per-label
  rules the plugin had, each behind its own switch so that a label which
  changes nothing about the torrents in it stays the default. Rename is three
  existing calls rather than a new method, because the plugin had none.
- **A Label column** in the torrent list, shown by default. The sidebar could
  already count labels and filter on them; nothing could show which torrent
  had which.
- **A Label submenu** on the torrent right-click menu, listing every label with
  the current one marked, and *No Label* to take a torrent out of one. It works
  on a whole selection, and reads the list each time it opens rather than when
  the page loaded, so a label another program has just created is there.
- Two differences from the plugin, both deliberate. `label.add` on a label that
  already exists answers `false` instead of raising, because clients add before
  every use and swallow the error anyway. And `label.set_torrent` with a label
  nobody created **creates it**: the add is the call most likely to have been
  skipped or lost, and refusing means a download silently lands with no
  category.

### Fixed

- **The interface asked for events about twenty times a second.**
  `web.get_events` is a long poll: the front end asks again the instant it is
  answered, which is right for an endpoint that waits and a busy loop for one
  that does not. This server answered empty straight away, so a single open tab
  made roughly six hundred requests a minute at a daemon that had nothing to
  say. The answer is held now until an event arrives or twenty-five seconds
  pass. Measured on an idle tab: 592 requests in thirty seconds before, 28 in
  sixty seconds after.
- **The progress bar was drawn two fifths of its width, with the percentage cut
  off inside it.** The buffered grid view set each cell's style *after* calling
  the renderer rather than before, and the metadata object is one object reused
  across the row, so every renderer saw the previous column's style. The
  progress bar came out as wide as the Size column beside it. The stock
  `Ext.grid.GridView` has always done it the other way round; only this
  vendored subclass did not.
- **A change to anything but the script bundle did not reach a browser.** Asset
  URLs carried the length of the JavaScript bundle, and that same key went on
  the stylesheets, the icons and the other script bundle too, so a fix confined
  to any of those left every URL identical and browsers kept the previous
  build's copy for the hour the cache header allows. Found the hard way: the
  progress-bar fix above was in the image, served, and not running. The key is
  now a digest over every embedded asset.
- **"Active" counted torrents that were not doing anything.** It matched on
  state, so every finished torrent sat in the one category meant for what is
  worth watching. Active is not a state but a question about right now, and
  Deluge asks it as "download or upload rate above zero": a seeding torrent
  nobody is downloading from is idle. The count and the filter use the same
  rule, so they agree.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-09-12

**This is where Deluge became redeluge.**

The fork point is Deluge `2.2.1.dev0-43`, upstream commit
[`e58075416`](https://github.com/deluge-torrent/deluge/commit/e58075416dedd53636e89b1cd240f86f2e7c2ee0).
Everything in this section is the fork. Everything below
[Deluge, before the fork](#deluge-before-the-fork) is upstream history, kept
because it is where the behaviour redeluge reproduces came from.

The Python management layer was replaced by Rust in five phases. libtorrent
stays as it is and is reached through a C++ bridge. The wire protocol, the
configuration files and the Web UI are unchanged, so existing clients and
existing installations keep working.

### Added

- `redeluged`, the daemon: DelugeRPC on port 58846 over TLS, all 70 methods of
  the daemon transport, the 22 events, torrent state, preferences, scrypt
  authentication, and labels.
- `redeluge-web`, the Web UI server: the JSON-RPC endpoint on port 8112 and the
  ExtJS front end, embedded in the binary rather than read from a directory.
- A frozen contract under `contract/`, extracted from the Python tree before it
  was deleted and now the reference the tests check against: 99 RPC methods,
  22 events, 96 configuration keys, 24 libtorrent alerts, 73 rencode
  conformance cases and 10 captured wire frames.
- Six crates: `redeluge-contract`, `redeluge-rencode`, `redeluge-rpc`,
  `redeluge-libtorrent`, `redeluge-daemon`, `redeluge-web`.
- `tools/migrate_state.py`, which converts the pickled torrent list to JSON. It
  is standalone, refuses to unpickle anything but the expected classes, and is
  the only Python that survives.
- A test gate, `docker/rust.sh`: formatting, clippy with warnings denied, the
  test suite, the contract check and the converter self-test, run on x86-64 and
  arm64. 286 tests.
- Container image with no interpreter in it, 189 MB, and systemd units for both
  binaries.
- Per-file `SPDX-License-Identifier` headers, and `AUTHORS` listing upstream
  authorship and the licences of the bundled front end.
- Four of Deluge's plugins as daemon features, off by default and configured
  through `core.conf` rather than through a plugin namespace of their own:
  labels, watched directories, the block list and the weekly schedule. See
  the Features page of the wiki.
- A label is a torrent option, set with `core.set_torrent_options`, reported in
  the status and counted in `core.get_filter_tree` beside state, tracker and
  owner. A label can now be set from the interface as well, in the
  Add dialog and in a torrent's Options tab; until then nothing in the Web UI
  could set one, so the sidebar's Labels list was always empty.
- Controls for the two settings redeluge added: the poll interval under
  Preferences, Interface, and a daemon's certificate fingerprint in the
  Connection Manager's Edit window. Both could only be set by editing
  `web.conf` by hand before.
- A *Fetch Now* button on the Block List page, which brings the next download
  forward without a method for it: it clears the stored timestamp and the
  minute-by-minute check does the rest. It is no longer a second file keyed by torrent id that can drift out
  of step with the first.
- `set_ip_filter` on the libtorrent bridge, which is what the block list
  installs into.
- `.github/workflows/docker.yml`, which builds the image and publishes it to
  the repository's package registry. Started by hand, because publishing
  follows a version bump rather than a push. The tag is the version in
  `[workspace.package]` of `Cargo.toml` and nothing else, and the run stops
  rather than replacing a version already in the registry.
- OCI labels on the image, so the version and the commit it was built from are
  readable without pulling it.
- Documentation as a wiki under `wiki/`, mirrored to the GitHub wiki by a
  workflow on every push that touches it. The repository is the source; pages
  edited in the wiki interface are overwritten.
- `docs/openapi.yaml`: an OpenAPI 3.1 description of the HTTP API, one schema
  per method, generated from the frozen contract by `tools/gen_openapi.py` and
  checked by the gate so it cannot drift.
- `webutils.get_themes` and `webutils.get_languages`, which the contract
  records and the dispatcher did not answer. Aliases of their `web.*` twins, as
  in Deluge.
- Ten Web UI methods that the shipped front end calls and nothing answered, so
  adding a torrent by any route was impossible from the interface and the
  connection manager did nothing: `web.get_torrent_info`,
  `web.get_magnet_info`, `web.download_torrent_from_url`, `web.add_torrents`,
  `web.get_torrent_status`, `web.get_torrent_files`, `web.add_host`,
  `web.edit_host`, `web.remove_host` and `web.stop_daemon`.
- `POST /upload`, the add-by-file endpoint, staging files under the
  configuration directory and refusing anything that is not a torrent.
- Preferences pages for watched folders, the block list and the schedule, the
  last of them a clickable grid of the week.
- The peer list in the torrent status, which was absent entirely, with peer
  countries from a MaxMind DB database when `geoip_db_location` names one.
- Move on completion, and the stop-and-remove-at-ratio rule, both of which were
  stored and reported and never acted on.
- `CreateTorrentProgressEvent`, reported from the hashing loop in C++ through
  the only callback that crosses from C++ into Rust.
- Minified script bundles, and the gzip compression whose feature was enabled
  and whose middleware was never added.
- Rate limiting on the Web UI login: five attempts, then one every thirty
  seconds, per client address.
- Reconnection to a restarted daemon, which previously needed the Web UI
  restarted too.
- Certificate pinning for a remote daemon, through `daemon_fingerprints` in
  `web.conf`.
- Magnet files in a watched directory, and zipped block lists.
- An HTTP integration test that boots the server, and an SSL torrent test that
  generates its own certificate authority.

### Changed

- Labels are a daemon feature rather than a plugin, because they shape the
  status a client asks for.
- The Web UI is English only. The translation catalogue was a server-rendered
  template masquerading as a static asset; dropping it removed the render step
  and the class of bug that came with it.
- Frames are bounded on read: 16 MiB per frame, 64 MiB per decompressed body.
  A compressed body declares its size only after it expands, and 200 KB
  expanding to 200 MB was accepted before.
- The daemon writes its configuration on first start. Loading filled in the
  defaults and nothing saved them, so a fresh install had no `core.conf`.

### Removed

- The Python implementation, in full: daemon, Web UI, GTK and console
  interfaces, plugins, translations, and the setuptools build.
- The plugin interface in the Web UI: the preferences page, the install dialog,
  the loader and the registry. `web.get_plugins` still answers, because it is
  in the contract, and nothing shipped calls it.
- Windows and macOS support. Linux only, from source or from the image.

### Changed

- **The interface is named after the fork.** The toolbar button, the browser
  tab and the About window read `RE:deluge`, and the About window says which
  version of the fork is running rather than only the Deluge version this
  server reports to clients. Every protocol-facing string is untouched: the
  daemon still reports `2.2.1` and still answers Deluge's API, because that is
  what a client written against the Python server expects.
- The Help button opens this project's wiki instead of upstream's user guide,
  and the About window links to the repository.

### Removed from the interface

Each of these was a control whose setting nothing read. The configuration keys
stay, because the daemon answers Deluge's API and a client that asks for them
must get them; only the controls are gone, and
[Configuration](https://github.com/retorrent/redeluge/wiki/Configuration) lists
every one with its reason.

- The Encryption page and the Cache page, whole. Encryption was never passed to
  libtorrent, and libtorrent 2.0 has no disk cache: it maps files into memory.
- Language, on the Interface page. There is one language.
- Updates and System Information, on the Other page, and the second copy of the
  release check on the Daemon page. Nothing checks for releases and nothing is
  sent anywhere.
- Peer Exchange and the Outgoing Ports group, on the Network page. libtorrent
  2.0 has neither setting.
- Force Use of Proxy. libtorrent 2.0 dropped it; the three switches above it
  are what it meant.
- Port, Enable SSL, Private Key and Certificate, on the Interface page. The
  server has always refused to move its own listener on a browser's say-so.
- Start Daemon, in the Connection Manager. The daemon is a service of its own.

### Fixed

- Choosing a theme in the Web UI stored the first letter of its name.
  `web.get_themes` answered with a flat list of names where the interface
  expects name and label pairs, so ExtJS read each name as a row and took
  character zero as the value: `gray` became `g`, and the page then asked for a
  stylesheet that does not exist. `web.set_theme` now refuses a theme with no
  stylesheet, and the page falls back to the default rather than rendering
  unstyled.
- A missing asset was answered with the page, so a browser asking for a
  stylesheet was handed HTML and reported a parse error rather than a missing
  file. A path that looks like a file now gets a 404; a front-end route still
  gets the page.
- `web.get_config` reported the theme from the startup snapshot rather than the
  live configuration, so the interface showed the previous choice until the
  server was restarted.
- Uploading a torrent from the add dialog failed with "Failed to upload
  torrent". `POST /upload` answered `application/json`, and a form with
  `fileUpload: true` is submitted through a hidden iframe whose document the
  browser builds from the response: only `text/html` makes it insert the body
  unchanged where ExtJS can read it back. The Python server set `text/html` for
  the same reason.
- The interface polled more than it needed to. Nine places call the update
  loop directly, and each one started a poll on top of the pending one, so a
  burst of clicking produced overlapping requests. A poll now replaces the
  pending one and will not start while another is in flight, and the interval
  is `poll_interval` in `web.conf` rather than the number 2000 written into
  five places in the JavaScript.
- Asset URLs carry the build's identity. They are cached for an hour, so an
  upgraded server served new JavaScript that browsers ignored until the cache
  expired, running the old front end against the new API.
- **Seventeen preferences did nothing.** Every torrent was added with a
  hard-coded set of options rather than the configured ones, so the whole "Add
  Torrent Options" group, the per-torrent bandwidth limits and the seeding
  rules could be changed and meant nothing. They are read now, on every route a
  torrent arrives by, and a dictionary the client sends still wins over them.
  `queue_new_to_top`, `copy_torrent_file` and `torrentfiles_location` work too,
  and "prioritise first and last pieces" now actually raises the priority of
  the pieces at each end of each file instead of only being remembered.
- Limits set while adding a torrent were stored and not applied, so a torrent
  added with a speed cap ran uncapped until something set the option a second
  time.
- The three feature preferences pages wrote their settings back even when
  nobody had opened them, which is what the Preferences window does to every
  page on OK. An unopened page holds defaults and an empty grid, so pressing OK
  erased the watched-folder list and reset the weekly schedule. A page that has
  not read its settings now writes nothing.
- A blank number field in those pages serialised as `null`, and `serde` fills
  in a key that is absent rather than one that is present and null, so a single
  null made the daemon discard the whole feature configuration and say so every
  few seconds. Both ends are fixed, and a complaint about a configuration is
  logged once rather than on every pass of the timer.
- The Block List page dropped the two keys the daemon writes, so every Apply
  looked like a list that had never been fetched and the next check downloaded
  it again.
- The watched-folders preferences page threw as it built itself. Its Add button
  handler was called `onAdd`, which is a method `Ext.Container` calls on itself
  every time anything is added to the panel, so the handler ran against a store
  that did not exist yet. A test now refuses either name on the new pages.
- **The preferences window cut its pages off.** The card layout sizes the
  active page to the window, so a page taller than that simply ended below the
  frame with nothing to say so and no way to reach the rest: the Bandwidth page
  lost its per-torrent limits and the Schedule page lost everything below the
  grid. Every page scrolls now, the window is wide enough for the widest of
  them, and it can be resized.
- The watched-folder grid was six hundred pixels wide in a three-hundred-pixel
  page, so three of its six columns were drawn past the frame and could not be
  reached at all. It tracks the page now.
- "Scan every (seconds):" was drawn as three lines with its spinner across
  them, and "Maximum Connection Attempts per Second:" and "Pin sha256:" each
  wrapped onto two. A form lays every field out at the label column's width, so
  a column narrower than the caption does not wrap the caption, it draws the
  field on top of it.
- The add dialog's Options tab had the same cut-off ending as the preferences
  pages.
- A long torrent name was cut at the edge of its cell with no ellipsis, because
  the name is drawn in a block inside the cell and overflowed on its own terms
  rather than the cell's.
- **The Files tab was blank for every torrent.** The daemon never reported
  `files`, `file_progress` or `file_priorities`, so `web.get_torrent_files`
  built an empty tree. They are reported now, and like the peer list they are
  only fetched when a client asks for them.
- The sidebar listed its filter groups alphabetically, which put Labels first
  and States third, because the JSON object they arrive in comes back with its
  keys sorted rather than in the order the daemon wrote them. The Web UI orders
  them itself now.
- Torrents with no label showed as a blank row with a count beside it and
  nothing to say what it was. That group is named now, "No Label" or "No
  Owner".
- The last rows of a long torrent list rendered empty. The buffered grid view
  placed its render window with a constant row height, so any deviation from
  it, a browser zoom, a larger font, a theme with more padding, walked the
  window off the bottom of the viewport, and far enough down the list inverted
  it and blanked every row on screen. It measures the real row pitch now, and
  cannot produce an inverted window.
- Three grid renderers could raise, which stops the grid's render loop and
  empties every row it had not reached, looking exactly like the bug above. The
  torrent name indexed the state without checking it, the progress bar indexed
  a regular expression match without checking it, and the peer flag called a
  string method on a field that may not be sent.
- The peers tab drew its progress bar `NaN` pixels wide. It read `this.width`,
  but a grid renderer is called unbound unless its column sets a scope. Both
  progress renderers now read the width from the metadata the grid passes.
- Peer country flags were broken images: the interface asks for `flag/<code>`
  per row, which is Deluge's own URL, and nothing answered it. The flags are
  shipped and the route validates the code rather than pasting it into a path.
- Tracker icons were a 404 per row on every refresh. Deluge's web server
  fetched each tracker's favicon; redeluge has no such fetcher and will not
  make outbound requests to every host a torrent names, so the grid column and
  the sidebar filter stopped asking for an image that cannot exist.
- The `Allocating` and `Moving` states had no icon in the torrent list or the
  sidebar, leaving an empty indent where one belongs.
- A label or owner containing a quote or a `<` broke the sidebar row it was in:
  the filter template put the value into a class attribute and into the text
  without escaping either.

Defects inherited from upstream and found while porting:

- Two stylesheet references had never resolved, since well before the fork. The
  About window's masthead pointed into a directory the web root does not have,
  so that window has always been blank at the top, and the add dialog's spinner
  was a root-absolute path missing a segment, which would also have broken
  under a base path. A test now walks every `url()` in the stylesheets we own.

- The daemon would not start with pyOpenSSL 26.4, which removed
  `crypto.X509Req`. Rust generates the keypair itself and the dependency is
  gone.
- The daemon certificate Deluge writes is X.509 version 1, which modern TLS
  stacks refuse. An unusable pair is moved aside, not overwritten, and
  regenerated.
- A version string containing `dev` made the Web UI request unbundled sources
  that a release build does not ship.
- `rencode` 1.0.8 hardcoded x86 compiler flags and would not build on arm64.
- Two configuration keys were missing, one was listed twice and one did not
  exist; found by checking the implementation against the contract.

### Migration

- Run `python3 tools/migrate_state.py ~/.config/deluge` once. Nothing is
  deleted, and the daemon refuses to start until it is done rather than
  presenting an empty torrent list.
- `core.conf`, `web.conf`, `hostlist.conf` and the auth file are read as they
  are. A password stored as the old single-round SHA-1 is rewritten as scrypt
  on first use. The `localclient` account stays as it is, because local tools
  read that password back out of the file.

- Ported to Python 3

### Core

- Improved Logging
- Removed the AutoAdd feature on the core. It's now handled with the AutoAdd
  plugin, which is also shipped with Deluge, and it does a better job and
  now, it even supports multiple users perfectly.
- Authentication/Permission exceptions are now sent to clients and recreated
  there to allow acting upon them.
- Updated SSL/TLS Protocol parameters for better security.
- Make the distinction between adding to the session new unmanaged torrents
  and torrents loaded from state. This will break backwards compatibility.
- Pass a copy of an event instead of passing the event arguments to the
  event handlers. This will break backwards compatibility.
- Allow changing ownership of torrents.
- File modifications on the auth file are now detected and when they happen,
  the file is reloaded. Upon finding an old auth file with an old format, an
  upgrade to the new format is made, file saved, and reloaded.
- Authentication no longer requires a username/password. If one or both of
  these is missing, an authentication error will be sent to the client
  which should then ask the username/password to the user.
- Implemented sequential downloads.
- Provide information about a torrent's pieces states
- Add Option To Specify Outgoing Connection Interface.
- Fix potential for host_id collision when creating hostlist entries.

### Gtk UI

- Ported to GTK3 (3rd-party plugins will need updated).
- Allow changing ownership of torrents.
- Host entries in the Connection Manager UI are now editable.
- Implemented sequential downloads UI handling.
- Add optional pieces bar instead of a regular progress bar in torrent status tab.
- Make torrent opening compatible with all Unicode paths.
- Fix magnet association button on Windows.
- Add keyboard shortcuts for changing queue position:
  - Up: `Ctrl+Alt+Up`
  - Down: `Ctrl+Alt+Down`
  - Top: `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Up`
  - Bottom: `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Down`

### Web UI

- Server (deluge-web) now daemonizes by default, use '-d' or '--do-not-daemonize' to disable.
- Fixed the '--base' option to work for regular use, not just with reverse proxies.

### Blocklist Plugin

- Implemented whitelist support to both core and GTK UI.
- Implemented IP filter cleaning before each update. Restarting the deluge
  daemon is no longer needed.
- If "check_after_days" is 0(zero), the timer is not started anymore. It
  would keep updating one call after the other. If the value changed, the
  timer is now stopped and restarted using the new value.
